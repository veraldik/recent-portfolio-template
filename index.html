				<h2>Meet The Designer<br>
				<p>I am currently going into my senior year as an Undergraduate student at Michigan State University! I work as a leasing agent at Cedar Village and spend my free time playing video games and making poorly drawn renditions of cats!
				<br><br>I recently switched my major after discovering an interest in media information and have been taking as many classes as I can to try and get exposure. Some of the other distinctions I have tried include: Physics (it was literally rocket science), Pre-law (scary competitive) and Accounting (math was/is hard). Having jumped around from major to major, I feel I was able to really narrow down and pick a major that suits me and is enjoyable
